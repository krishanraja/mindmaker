# Mindmake private brief delivery

*Current as of 6 September 2026.*

Status: **live**. The backend launched 26 August 2026 and Krish approved Gate E on 27 August 2026, so the public flag is on and the full journey runs in production: the migration and retention purge are applied, the functions are deployed at the versions recorded in `06_CURRENT_STATE.md`, which is the only place versions are written down, the sender `Mindmake <briefs@mindmake.co>` is verified with SPF, DKIM and DMARC passing, and the complete verification, delivery and tailored-choice matrix passed against the live backend with synthetic inboxes.

## Product boundary

The private brief must feel useful before Mindmake asks for an email. It must also create a clear lead for Krish without pretending that a generated starting point is a finished diagnosis.

The release rules are:

- no public diary or Calendly link;
- no automated sales or nurture sequence beyond the single day-14 follow-up (see the amendment at the end of this file);
- no automatic publication subscription or list import;
- no visitor-written narrative, email HTML or hidden qualification data accepted by the server;
- no claim that an email was delivered unless that delivery was accepted by the email provider;
- no loss of the visitor's local download when a network or email step fails.

## Visitor journey

1. The visitor gives four details: first name, last name, work email and the part
   of the business they work in. The company domain is derived from the email. A
   personal address is refused on the page and again at the server, because the
   read is built from the company behind the domain. Both doors ask for exactly
   this, in one shared component, with one set of rules.
2. Mindmake shows a declarative public-company read and labels a safe fallback honestly when live research does not answer. The read never asks the visitor anything or invites a correction; any sentence that does is dropped server-side and client-side before display.
3. The visitor chooses one pressure. When the read was strong enough, the choices are two or three statements tailored to that company, generated and HMAC-signed by the server, each anchored to one locked lens; `Something else` reveals the locked list, which is also the guaranteed path whenever generation fails or runs out of time.
4. The visitor chooses where better use of their time would matter.
5. Mindmake shows a private starting recommendation, framed as an illustrative example of how the Mindmake brain reads a business from the outside, with the explicit line that none of it is advice.
6. Only then does the visitor choose whether to keep it by email.
7. The work email is already there, carried from step 1, and the visitor may
   separately tick an unticked publication-interest box. Changing it here still
   creates a fresh request.
8. Mindmake sends a six-digit code. The code works for ten minutes and locks after five failed tries.
9. Only after the code is confirmed does Mindmake try the two final deliveries independently, and the branded proposal renders on screen.
10. The visitor can download the private HTML brief whether or not either email succeeds.

Changing the email or asking for a new code creates a fresh request. A network retry of the same request keeps the same request ID so it cannot create duplicate delivery work.

## Browser contract

The browser sends identifiers and choices only. It never sends the recommendation, company narrative, research evidence, email HTML or operator copy. The one piece of prose it may carry is a tailored-choice label the server itself authored and signed; the server verifies that signature against the domain and lens before trusting the label.

Request action:

```ts
interface MindmakeBriefRequestActionV2 {
  version: 2;
  action: "request";
  requestId: string;
  contact: { email: string };
  company: { domain: string };
  choices: {
    pressureId: MindmakePressureId;
    returnedTimeId: MindmakeReturnedTimeId;
    entryRoute: "home" | "brain" | "gtm";
    tailored?: { id: string; label: string };
  };
  consent: {
    publicationRequested: boolean;
    wordingVersion: "mindmake-publication-consent-v1";
  };
  website: "";
}
```

Confirmation action:

```ts
interface MindmakeBriefConfirmActionV2 {
  version: 2;
  action: "confirm";
  requestId: string;
  contact: { email: string };
  code: string;
  tailored?: { id: string; label: string };
}
```

The `website` field is a bot trap and must remain empty.

Tailored-choice rules: `id` is an HMAC-SHA256 signature over the domain, lens and label using the server's verification secret, created by `enrich-company` and carried back unchanged. On the request action an invalid pair is rejected with 400 `tailored_choice_invalid`. On the confirm action the pair is verified against the stored row's domain and lens; a mismatch falls back gracefully to the lens label rather than failing the confirmed lead. Nothing tailored is persisted; the lens keeps owning the recommendation content and the tailored label only changes what the pressure is called in the proposal, the emails and the digest.

The browser accepts only these response states:

```ts
interface VerificationRequiredResponseV2 {
  version: 2;
  success: true;
  status: "verification_required";
  requestId: string;
}

interface ConfirmedBriefResponseV2 {
  version: 2;
  success: true;
  status: "confirmed";
  leadId: string;
  visitorDelivery: "queued" | "failed";
  operatorDelivery: "queued" | "failed";
  publicationInterestRecorded: boolean;
}
```

`queued` means the email provider accepted the send request. It does not prove inbox delivery or that anyone read the message. The page reports each delivery separately and never turns a missing or unknown response into a success claim.

## Server-owned work

The server validates an exact field allowlist and rejects extra narrative fields. It then:

1. normalises the email and domain;
2. applies rate limits to one-way hashes of the email and internet address;
3. researches the public company or creates an honest fallback;
4. builds the recommendation from allowlisted choice IDs and server-owned rules;
5. stores the request and delivery state in the private schema;
6. creates and emails the verification code;
7. verifies the submitted code;
8. creates the visitor brief and Krish's fit summary from its own templates;
9. attempts the two final emails independently;
10. returns only the final delivery states and publication-interest state.

The six-digit code is never stored as plain text. The database stores a keyed hash and a nonce. Raw internet addresses and browser descriptions are not stored in the private brief tables. Only one-way hashes used for abuse limits are stored.

The private schema is not readable by public or signed-in browser roles. The public wrapper rejects those roles and accepts only the service role used by the Edge Function.

## What the visitor receives

The visitor email is set in the proposal design language (paper ground, emerald cover rule, Mindmake × company cover, serif pressure headline, labelled cards) and contains:

- the chosen pressure (the tailored label when one was verified);
- the public company read and its source label;
- the evidence used;
- what AI may carry;
- what should stay with the leader;
- one useful 30-day proof;
- where the returned time could create more value;
- the branded proposal document as a self-contained HTML attachment (system fonts, no scripts, no external requests, printable);
- the honesty foot: the read is an illustrative example and is not advice.

It contains no diary link and no automatic sales promise. It does not claim that Krish received his separate email. After the server returns `operatorDelivery: "queued"`, the UI may say only that Krish's copy was queued. The line "No sales emails will follow automatically" stays, and Reply-To is the operator mailbox so "reply to this email" is honest.

## What Krish receives

Krish's server-made fit digest shares the proposal design language and is ordered for a fast scan:

- the tailored or lens pressure as the headline;
- the leader: verified email (Reply-To reaches them directly), company and domain;
- the public company read, its source and evidence;
- what they chose: the pressure (naming the lens behind a tailored choice) and the returned time;
- the brief they received: the server-owned AI, human and 30-day proof recommendation;
- a route-specific note about where a useful first proof may sit;
- the exact publication-interest state and wording version;
- a reply rule: reply only with a useful thought, a strong fit or a clear question worth testing.

The operator email must never tell Krish to chase the visitor or import the address into the publication.

## Publication interest

- The box is separate and unticked.
- `true` means unverified interest only.
- `false` means no interest was requested.
- Neither value subscribes anyone.
- No record is imported automatically or manually from this flow.
- A later publication sign-up must use the publication provider's own verified process.
- There is no recurring personalised watch in this release.

## Failure behaviour

- Company research fails: use the honest fallback and let the visitor continue.
- Verification email fails: do not move to confirmation; keep the local brief available.
- Code is invalid, expired or locked: show a plain error and do not send either final email.
- Visitor delivery fails: do not say the brief was emailed; keep the download available.
- Operator delivery fails: do not say Krish has the context.
- Both final deliveries fail after confirmation: show the local download and a direct email fallback.
- One final delivery succeeds: report only that delivery.
- A delivery retry uses an independent idempotency key so one email cannot duplicate the other.

## Retention truth

The code works for ten minutes and five failed tries lock it. Expiry stops the code but does not delete the request record. The approved retention schedule runs as a private daily purge (Gate B1, 26 August 2026): unverified requests delete 7 days after creation, rate-limit event hashes after 48 hours, and verified request, consent and delivery records 12 months after their last update. Earlier deletion happens through the published contact address and a manually verified private process. The public privacy notice states the same schedule.

The two-email cap and the personal read carry retention rules added on 28 and 29 August 2026, run by `mindmake_purge_follow_ups()` at the end of each day's `send-follow-ups` run rather than the brief purge above: a sent follow-up row deletes 7 days after it sends, an unsent one 60 days after it was created, personal-read rate-limit hashes after 48 hours, and a personal read record 12 months after creation.

## Release gate (closed 27 August 2026)

Every item of the release contract passed before the flag went on, and Krish gave the explicit Gate E approval on 27 August 2026: migration and security advisers, private-schema isolation from anonymous and signed-in roles, service-role wrapper boundaries, exact origins and secret configuration, the full request, resend, change-email and code matrix, both independent deliveries with synthetic inboxes, idempotent retries, inspected email output, publication-interest boundaries and the retention schedule with its manual deletion process.

Any future change to the pipeline re-runs the relevant part of that contract before deploying, and a synthetic end-to-end lead from `https://mindmake.co` (code read from the provider's synthetic inbox, all three sends `delivered`) is the minimum proof after every function deploy. A provider `queued` response is never claimed as inbox delivery.


## Amendment, 28 August 2026: the two-email cap

The release rule that forbade any automated sequence is replaced by a bounded
one. A lead receives exactly two emails, ever:

1. **The results email**, unchanged. Sent on confirmation by
   `submit-mindmake-brief`, or by `mindmake-personal-read` for a visitor who
   completed the personal journey instead.
2. **One follow-up, fourteen days later**, sent by `send-follow-ups` from a
   daily 09:20 UTC job. Subject: "The better version of our offer". One short
   paragraph, one sharper offer, one link back to the start. No images and no
   tracking beyond the mailer's defaults.

Nothing else sends. There is still no drip, no newsletter from this site and no
list import; the publication remains a separate choice the visitor makes
themselves.

What keeps the cap true rather than merely stated:

- `follow_up_queue` is unique on `(email, source)`, so a returning visitor
  cannot stack a second follow-up.
- Each send carries a deterministic idempotency key derived from the queue row,
  so a rerun cannot duplicate a message.
- `sent_at` is written only when the provider accepted the message, and a row
  that fails three times is abandoned rather than retried forever.
- The row is purged seven days after it sends. The public privacy notice states
  this schedule.
- `src/test/brief2-email-cap.test.ts` walks every function under
  `supabase/functions` and fails if the set of things that can send mail, or the
  set of places a follow-up can be created, ever grows.


## Amendment, 29 August 2026: the read has to earn the send

The personal read on `/ai-brain` went out once as a job title pasted on the
front of three template sentences, chosen by two taps, so everybody who tapped
the same pair received the same email with their name on it. The verdict on it
was "embarrassingly generic, I'd rather send nothing". That is now the
implemented behaviour rather than a preference.

**What the read is made of.** The paragraph that leads it is the synthesised
outside read of the visitor's actual company, produced by the same
`assembleDossier` orchestrator `/ai-gtm` runs on, reused in process. Everything
after it describes what the brain would do, and those lines are templates on
purpose, because they describe our product and our product does not vary by
visitor. What has to vary is the company, and now it does.

**The gate.** `assessRead` in `mindmake-personal-read/core.ts` reads the
assembled read the way its recipient would and refuses to let it be sent if the
answer to any of these is anything short of yes. A refusal returns
`not_worth_sending`, the page says so plainly, and no email is sent.

1. Is there anything here that could only have been written about this company?
2. Would this same paragraph fit their closest competitor without changing a word?
3. Does it claim to know something about them that nothing outside could know?
4. Does it state a role or company that enrichment did not actually establish?
5. Is the only specific thing in it their own job title, handed back to them?
6. Is it short enough to be read in under a minute?
7. Does it use an em dash, American spellings, or raise its voice?
8. Does it carry placeholder residue, or the same sentence twice?
9. Is every sentence plain enough to follow at speed?
10. Is the company we are naming actually the one behind their email address?
11. Does it pass judgement on how established or successful they are?
12. Does it tell them their organisation is failing or under strain?
13. Does it flatter them instead of observing them?
14. Does it recite their infrastructure back at them?
15. Does it ask the reader more than one thing?

**Repair comes before refusal.** The synthesis reliably writes four good
sentences and then one more that recites the stack, grades how established the
company is, or flatters it. Refusing the whole read over the last sentence
throws away four good ones to avoid a bad one, and the reader loses a real read
because a model would not stop writing. So `sanitiseDescriptor` drops the
sentences that cannot be sent and keeps the ones that can, and the gate then
runs on what is left. A paragraph that is nothing but bad sentences ends up
empty and is refused on the specificity question, which is the honest outcome
for it.

**Why these are deterministic.** A judge that scores the same input differently
on two runs cannot be a hard gate on a live send path, and a gate that sometimes
lets a bad email through is not a gate. What a machine cannot check is written
here rather than pretended away: it cannot tell whether the paragraph is *true*,
only whether it is specific, in voice, and within its rights.

**Where the questions came from.** Every one of them is a thing that actually
happened, not a thing imagined. Questions 10, 11 and 12 were written after three
live runs: Brandfetch resolved a one-person consultancy's company to the
founder's personal name, so the email would have opened "You are Director at
Kristof Hermans"; the synthesis told a real business it was "still establishing
your market position", which is a verdict on somebody's company delivered
unasked; and it recited the reader's own hosting stack back at them, which reads
as surveillance rather than insight.

**What the live battery taught, on 29 August 2026.** Fourteen real domains were
run through the deployed function and the results read rather than counted. It
found seven defects, six of which no hand-written fixture would ever have
produced, and `src/test/read-live-corpus.test.ts` now holds the paragraphs it
actually returned so a future model or provider change shows up as a failing
test rather than as a worse email.

| What came back | What it exposed |
|---|---|
| "built on Salesforce, Contentful and Ruby on Rails" | A vendor list can never be complete. The construction is the tell, so the rule now matches "built on / powered by / runs on" followed by named products. |
| "now employing 501, 1000 people" | Our own dash rule turned a headcount band into two wrong numbers. A dash between digits is a range, not a clause. |
| "University Of Oxford" | Company names need the same minor-word rule as job titles. |
| "You remain the world's leading research and teaching institution" | Flattery is the verdict rule with its sign flipped, and it is what the visitor came here to get away from. |
| "you face chronic funding pressures and waiting list backlogs" | True, widely reported, and still not ours to hand somebody unasked. The house rule against doom is not only about the word "failing". |
| "YAY! Mushrooms" | A real Marks and Spencer product. A bare test for an exclamation mark refused a good read over a brand name; our own shouting ends a word, a brand carries the mark inside a capitalised token. |
| Four whole reads refused over one trailing sentence | The remedy was wrong, not just the rule. Repair now comes before refusal. |

The re-run that verified those fixes exposed the next layer down, which is what
iterating against real data looks like rather than a sign something is wrong:

| What came back | What it exposed |
|---|---|
| "Marks And Spencer", "University Of Oxford" | The dossier's own name skipped the minor-word rule that job titles already had. |
| "Shopify.com" | A provider handed back the hostname as the name. The first fix keyed on case, on the theory that a raw hostname arrives in lower case and a real name carries a capital; the pipeline then returned "Shopify.com" with the capital and the rule never fired on the case it was written for. The suffix now comes off only when the name restates the visitor's own domain, which is when it carries nothing they do not already know. The cost is that a visitor at Booking.com, which really is called that, would be addressed as "Booking": one company against every company whose provider hands back a hostname. |
| "Shopify remains the dominant...", "You remain the backbone of British healthcare" | The flattery rule only matched a second-person subject. |
| The NHS read cut to two thin sentences | The specificity floor was measured across the whole body, so stripping the doom sentence left the part that carries the specifics nearly empty while the total still cleared. The floor now applies to the repaired paragraph itself. |

Six of the gate's own fixtures failed against that raised floor because they were
shorter than anything the pipeline actually returns. The fixtures were lengthened
rather than the floor lowered: it is calibrated from real reads, which run to
three hundred characters and up.

### Why the gate keeps finding the next phrasing, and what would stop it

Three passes of the doom rule each caught the phrasing in front of it and missed
the next one: "chronic funding pressures", then "waiting list backlogs", then
"limited resources and mounting demand". The rule now matches the qualifier and
lets the noun be anything, which generalises further, but the pattern is worth
naming rather than fixing again quietly.

**The filtering is compensating for a prompt aimed somewhere else.**
`synthesizeDescriptor` was written for `/ai-gtm`, where the paragraph is
addressed to a company about its market and "you face rising costs" is on brief.
The personal read reuses it unchanged, so doom, flattery and stack recitals are
not stray defects: they are the GTM prompt working as intended, in a place that
wants something different.

**The durable fix was a personal-read variant of the prompt**, and it is now in
place as `synthesiseWorkingLife` inside the personal-read function. The shared
`synthesizeDescriptor` is untouched, because `/ai-gtm` has been reviewed and
approved as it is; this is a second prompt on the same provider plumbing.

**The two reads are different artefacts, and that is the point.** The GTM prompt
says so itself: a sharp outside read of a company, ending on a plain statement
about the business. A leader asking what AI changes about their own capability
and output is asking a different question, and for a while this page answered
the first one with a job title pasted on the front. The company read is now the
*input* to the personal one rather than the thing that gets sent: what comes
back is about the seat, what somebody in it spends their judgement on, and where
the ceiling on their own week sits. If the personal read cannot be written,
nothing is sent, because falling back to the company read is how the page ended
up generic in the first place.

### What testing real people found

Five of Krish's own LinkedIn connections were run through the live person
lookup on 29 August 2026, using their real names and their real employers'
domains. Preview only: nothing was stored and no email was sent to any of them.

| Person | What PDL returned | What they actually do |
|---|---|---|
| Lisa Burton | Vice President at HearstLab | correct |
| Lewis Maleh | Founder and Chief Executive at Bentley Lewis | correct |
| Abimbola Ikusika | Customer Success Specialist at Accomplishr | correct |
| Alanna Laforet | no match, read refused | enGEN3 has thin public data, and the refusal is the system working |
| Jay Gilden | Co-founder and Executive Director at Openly | **wrong person**. He is I&A Associate Director at Wavemaker |

**One in four resolved matches was the wrong human being.** That number matters
more than any of the presentation defects, because the others make a read read
badly and this one makes it say something false about a named individual in an
email addressed to them personally.

It also corrects an earlier claim. Two of three public figures were reported as
resolving, as though that were a hit rate; nobody had checked whether the two
were the *right* people. Benioff and Collison happen to be unmistakable. Ordinary
names are where this breaks, and Jay Gilden is an ordinary name.

### The employer cross-check

PDL treats the company as a signal rather than a filter, so a common name comes
back attached to the wrong employer. Testing with real people rather than
invented ones returned an I&A associate director at Wavemaker as a co-founder at
Openly: same name, different person. `min_likelihood` cannot catch that, because
the match is confident and wrong. The employer PDL returns is now checked
against the domain that was asked about, and a mismatch discards the person and
falls back to a company-only read. A wrong job title is worse than no job title,
and an email that opens by telling somebody they work somewhere they do not is
the worst version of it.

Verified against the case that exposed it: Jay Gilden at wavemaker.com now
returns a company-only read, and Lisa Burton at hearstlab.com still resolves.
The control matters as much as the case. A guard that discarded everybody would
look identical to a guard that worked, if the only thing checked was that the
bad match stopped appearing.

`src/test/read-quality-gate.test.ts` holds forty-odd scenarios against it,
including every division, every pair of answers, a descriptor in another
language, a company that capitalises itself oddly, and the provider states that
return nothing. One of them earns its place twice: the first version of the
"passes judgement" rule matched the bare word "behind", which appears in the
Product division's own line as a preposition, so it would have silently refused
every visitor who picked Product and nobody would have known why.

## Amendment, 29 August 2026: every dead end ends in a person

The gate above is the right behaviour and it was only half a change. A read that
cannot be written well enough to send is not sent, and until this amendment the
visitor was then told so and left there. Alanna Laforet at enGEN3 is the shape of
it: a real person gave four true details, waited, and received one sentence
explaining that nothing was coming. She is a lead we asked to leave.

Nine failure paths across the site did the same thing. Not one offered a human,
and by the time most of them fire **the page already holds the visitor's first
name, last name, work email and division**, so the offer does not need a form.
It needs a button.

### The nine

| Where | Offer | Details already held |
|---|---|---|
| `/ai-brain` read refused by the gate | panel | yes |
| `/ai-brain` read request failed | panel, with a retry | yes |
| `/ai-brain` rate limited | panel | yes |
| `/ai-brain` results email would not send | panel, with a retry | yes |
| Shared capture, personal address | quiet line inside the error | partly, carried across |
| `/ai-gtm` verification code would not send | quiet line | yes, from the journey |
| `/ai-gtm` code wrong, expired or locked | quiet line | yes, from the journey |
| `/ai-gtm` neither delivery confirmed | panel | yes, from the journey |
| Ask bar, unmatched question | quiet line | no, so it asks |

Two paths deliberately have no offer. The `/ai-gtm` live company read failing is
not a dead end: the journey carries on to a real recommendation and a real
hand-off, and a second door beside a working one only asks somebody to guess
which is the real one. It gained the honesty about whose fault it is instead.
The live market board is content rather than conversion, and stays as it is.

The rule for which shape: a **panel** where the road is definitively closed, so
the offer is one click; a **quiet line** where a working retry is sitting right
there, so the panel does not shout over it.

### The register

Dry and self-deprecating, and the machine is the butt of the joke every time.
Never the visitor: a joke at the expense of somebody who has just been let down
is not levity, it is a second insult. The apology comes first and plainly, then
one line about our own machine, then the button. Nobody arrived wanting to
laugh, so the joke is small and gets out of the way.

`src/content/handoff.ts` holds all nine, `src/test/human-handoff.test.tsx`
holds them to the house style, and both files are inside the site-wide copy
gates in `src/test/brief2-public-contract.test.ts`.

### The action

`mindmake-personal-read` takes a third action rather than growing a second
function: it already owns the origin allowlist, the HMAC identifiers, the
operator address and Resend. `submit-mindmake-brief` is untouched, so
`/ai-gtm`'s dead ends post here too; the action is a generic person-plus-reason
capture and does not care which page it came from.

Three things about it are deliberate and each undoes a way this could have gone
wrong:

- **It does not spend the read limiter.** That meter caps paid provider calls
  and results emails, and one of the reasons somebody arrives here is that they
  already tripped it. Charging them for asking for help would leave the dead end
  most in need of a way out with none.
- **It does not apply the work-address rule.** The rule exists to serve the
  reading, and by the time this action runs the reading has already failed.
  `personal-email` is one of the reasons a visitor can arrive with, so enforcing
  it here would answer "we cannot read your company" with "and we will not talk
  to you either".
- **The visitor gets no email.** Two emails ever is a published promise in
  `01_CANON.md` and a handoff is neither of them. The operator is told; a person
  replies as a person. What is capped instead is that notice, at one per address
  per hour, counted off the rows this function writes. Over the cap the row is
  still stored and the visitor is still told the truth, because it is with us
  either way.

### Where the row lives

`public.mindmake_personal_reads` gains `handoff_reason`, with a check constraint
mirroring the parser's allowlist exactly as `division`, `q1` and `q2` already do.
`q1` and `q2` stop being required and start being required together: a row is
either a read, with both answers, or a handoff, with a reason, and
`mindmake_personal_reads_shape_check` refuses anything that is half of each. RLS
is unchanged, still on with no policies, still service role only. No new
personal data is collected, and the retention schedule that covers this table
already covers all of it.
