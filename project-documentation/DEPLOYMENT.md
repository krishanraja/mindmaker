  - `RESEND_API_KEY` (email delivery - required for lead capture)
  - `LOVABLE_API_KEY` (AI gateway for news ticker - auto-provisioned)
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (payments - optional, currently paused)

### 3. Edge Functions
- [ ] All edge functions have CORS headers configured
- [ ] All edge functions handle OPTIONS preflight requests
- [ ] All edge functions return 200 on error with fallback data (anti-fragile design)

### 3. Edge Function Verification
- [ ] `chat-with-krish`: Send test message, verify response

- [ ] `send-lead-email`: (test environment only) Submit test lead
- [ ] `send-leadership-insights-email`: (test) Complete diagnostic and unlock

### 4. Log Scan

## Secret Configuration Guide

### Google Service Account Key
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "gen-lang-client-0174430158",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "...",
  "client_id": "...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
}
```
- Store as raw JSON (not base64 encoded)
- Ensure service account has Vertex AI permissions
- Project ID must match: `gen-lang-client-0174430158`

### Resend API Key
- Get from: https://resend.com/api-keys
- Format: `re_...`
- Ensure sending domain is verified (not using test domain)

### OpenAI API Key
- Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Format: `sk-...`
- Monitor usage to avoid quota issues

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are found post-deploy:

1. **Identify the issue** via logs and console
2. **Revert to previous commit** in Lovable
3. **Verify rollback** by running post-deploy checklist
4. **Document the issue** in COMMON_ISSUES.md

---

## Deployment Schedule

- **Preview deployments**: Automatic on every code change
- **Production**: Manual review after preview verification

---

## Edge Function Deployment

Edge functions auto-deploy when code is pushed. Allow 30-60 seconds for deployment.

### Verifying Deployment
1. Check Lovable Cloud logs for deployment timestamp
2. Test function endpoint directly
3. Verify secrets are available via `Deno.env.get()`

### Troubleshooting
- If function returns 404: Wait 60 seconds, then retry
- If secrets not found: Check Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Secrets
- If CORS errors: Verify OPTIONS handler and headers
